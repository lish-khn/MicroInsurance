# 🛡️ Micro Insurance Analysis & Modeling

This project explores the concept and application of **microinsurance** using Python. The goal is to analyze how small-scale insurance models can serve low-income individuals, particularly in developing regions, and to support the design of affordable, accessible insurance products through data insights.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and evaluate the effectiveness of microinsurance schemes in Pakistan using publicly available data from official government sources. The analysis focuses on:
- Risk pooling
- Claims frequency
- Premium affordability
- Policyholder segmentation
- Financial viability of microinsurance

## 📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project was fetched from the **official website of the Government of Pakistan**, ensuring reliability and relevance. The data includes information related to insurance penetration, claim ratios, population income levels, and other macro indicators.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – for predictive modeling


## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Imported and cleaned the dataset
- Parsed and formatted numeric and categorical data
- Verified integrity using summary statistics

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed policyholder demographics and claim patterns
- Explored premium vs. claim behavior
- Identified gaps in coverage across income and regional segments

### 3. Insights & Policy Suggestions
- Suggested premium bands based on affordability
- Identified underserved regions and demographics
- Evaluated sustainability through simplified risk modeling

## 📈 Key Insights

- Microinsurance has the potential to increase financial resilience among low-income groups
- Regional disparities exist in claims and access
- Optimized premium rates can balance accessibility and profitability

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add more recent or granular data from insurance companies or health departments
- Model future claims with simulation or machine learning
- Build a microinsurance planner dashboard using Streamlit
